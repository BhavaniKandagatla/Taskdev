   Output: Number of keys in the object: 3
   
•	Scope and Closures: 

1)	Create a function that returns a function which logs "Hello, [name]!" where [name] is the argument passed to the returned function.

   Output: Hello, Bhavani!
   
2)	Explain the output of the following code: 
javascript    
	var x = 10; 
	function foo() { 
	console.log(x); 
	var x = 20; 
	} 
	foo();

Exlained output in the program

Output: undefined

•	DOM Manipulation: 

1) Write a JavaScript code to change the text color of an element with id "myElement" to red.
